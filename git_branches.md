 # branches and teamwork
 
 Workflow
 1. Make a branch to commit subtask-changes without disturbing the "teamwork" on the main branch.
 2. Commit (tested) changes.
 3. Open a pull request.
 4. Review the pull request.
 5. Merge the branch with main when the subtask is finished.
 6. Delete the branch.
